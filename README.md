# genai-adoption-analysis
### Synopsis: 
Organizations are rapidly adopting generative AI(GenAI), but the true impact on workforce productivity remains unclear. Leaders seek evidence-backed guidance to:
Justify AI investments
Optimize training Strategies
Minimize Employee training
Align GenAI with business value
The GenAI wave (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) is reshaping enterprise workflows. While tech integration is widespread, thereâ€™s limited empirical evidence, comparing which tools perform better, and under what organizational contexts (e.g., workforce size, training intensity, sentiment response)
The project will utilize the "Enterprise GenAI Adoption and Workforce Impact Data" dataset available on Kaggle (Enterprise GenAI Adoption, n.d.) (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tfisthis/enterprise-genai-adoption-and-workforce-impact-data/data). It contains rich features related to Organization type, tool adopted, workforce impact, training efforts, productivity changes etc.

### Getting Started
To explore and run the analysis:

Clone the repository:
``` Bash
git clone https://github.com/barath-anandaraman/genai-adoption-analysis.git

# Install Dependencies: It's recommended to use a virtual environment.


pip install -r requirements.txt
```
``` Bash

jupyter lab
# or
jupyter notebook
#From the Jupyter interface, you can then open and run the productivity-dynamics.ipynb files
